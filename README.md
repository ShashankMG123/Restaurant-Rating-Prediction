# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction 

Every business wants to know if they can succeed or not. 
With the rapid growth of the food industry we have witnessed a rise in the number of restaurants around us. 
A key factor which determines how well a restaurant is doing is their rating on popular apps like zomato. 
We intend to predict this rating for an upcoming restaurant in bangalore. 
We can also recommend the location where the restaurant should be opened for higher rating/profits.
We will be using techniques like linear regression, elastic net regression,
logistic regression, Neural nets or a hybrid model  to make relevant prediction.
We will use various prediction models and finally choose the one that makes the best prediction. 
We can use the confusion matrix as a performance metric.

Can use jupyter-notebook to reproduce our results.
